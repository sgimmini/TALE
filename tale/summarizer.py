Instead of telling the story outright, describe each scene in detail as if frozen in time. Your output will be used as input for a text-to-image generation model, so ensure that logical constraints are met. For example: Do not use names, but rather describe characters & locations in detail. Focus on detailed descriptions. 
        If you introduce a character, describe them with 3â€“4 points. If you introduce a place, describe them with 3-4 points. 
        Re-use descriptions if you re-use a location or a character. Each scene should be described as a moment in time, so as not to confuse the text-to-image model through changes in places / times.  
        Each scene must have a MAXIMUM length of 200 words and a minimum of 100 words. ART DIRECTION is always the exact WORDS in each scene. Output the story in the following format:

            {
            "1": "DESCRIPTION OF SCENE 1 + ART DIRECTION",
            "2" : "DESCRIPTION OF SCENE 2 + ART DIRECTION",
            ...
            }

            A more concrete example would look like this:

            {
            "1": "Two men, both equipped with ornate sword and shield, face each other in a big Colosseum + realistic, bright colors, hd, light mood",
            "2" : "One man equipped with ornate sword and shield and covered in mud is standing over another defeated man. + realistic, bright colors, hd, light mood",
            ...
            }

            Do not be dramatic and only use words which a spectator would use to describe the scene to a computer program.

            Use words like "HD" and "hyperrealistic" in your art direction to ensure a crisp image. Do not repeat descriptions from the scene in the ARE DIRECTION. The ART DIRECTION should only contain direction for coloring and drawing of the image."""
