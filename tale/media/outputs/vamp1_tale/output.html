     In the first session, which took place at the end of January in the Tanzschule diabolus, I had a private lesson with Kristhtina. However, our lesson was interrupted by Flinn knocking on the door and delivering a cryptic letter from Elysangela.

     Intrigued, I fed from Kristhtina and then set out to find Esmeralda. I discovered that she was near the Burschi House and was likely in a restaurant. Esmeralda, a young and attractive woman, informed me that I would find the letters there.

     Moving on to the session on February 1st, some interesting events occurred. Professor Hunt was applying self-tanner, Thomas dressed impeccably, and I arrived punctually and neatly dressed.

     I asked a Burschi to take care of the coats, and Professor Hunt handed me a letter from his coat. Inside the venue, there were numerous banners representing different associations. Elysangela and Esmeralda were present, both dressed in vibrant red and adorned with jewelry and finery.
     I approached Professor Hand, who also seemed unimpressed with the situation. Surprisingly, Elias was working as security. Elysangela approached us and led us into an office where she revealed a confidential task.  Elias was the first subject of a project, and we were to choose a second subject. If we had any questions, Esmeralda was the person to contact. We then read the recipe for a cocktail that would establish a connection between the Anarch and Elias. Afterward, we returned to the Elysium, where I had a brief argument with Elias. Seth observed Elias, who appeared extremely uncertain. Professor Hand approached a Burschi and made a rather crude comment, which led to a challenge being issued against him. Elias asked where our "milk tooth" was, and I momentarily broke through the nonsense to find out why he had the job today.  This led to a brawl, with Seth inciting the crowd and me instructing a Burschi to strike Elias and collect his blood. We managed to escape and handed the blood to the Professor, who had the blood of a Burschi.

     Now, let's talk about the characters. Thomas, also known as Seth Clayton, was dressed elegantly with short, blonde hair and a well-groomed appearance. Professor Gwendolin Hand, played by Christian, had a bronzy-yellow complexion, leathery and multiple times lifted skin, shoulder-length black hair, and was dressed impeccably in the colors of the Burschis. He wore tailored clothing and a special edition Rolex.

In terms of worldbuilding, we learned that Prinz Prag tends to keep a low profile, and different organizations "govern" various parts of the city. Elysangela von Czernin is the Mistress of the Elysium and the highest authority for us at the moment. She is a dominant player in the vampire stage, with Esmeralda serving as her right-hand woman. Wolfgang Sternberg is the Sheriff of the city, with Elias as his right-hand man. The Camarilla primarily operates in the Old Town area, while the Anarchs have control over some parts of the city. Although there is conflict between the two factions, it is not openly fought and is generally tolerated. The KSTV Pragensis is an organization around which the Elysium is organized.

As the game progresses, we find ourselves embroiled in a web of political intrigue and power struggles within the vampire community of Prague. The cryptic letter from Elysangela and the task she has assigned us indicate that we are being drawn deeper into the machinations of this supernatural world. With our new mission to establish a connection between the Anarch and Elias, we must navigate the delicate balance of alliances and rivalries while uncovering the truth behind the brewing conflict between the Camarilla and the Anarchs. The city of Prague itself becomes a character in its own right, with different factions vying for control and the potential for chaos and bloodshed always lurking beneath the surface.

As we delve further into this tabletop roleplaying game, the stakes continue to rise, and the fate of our characters and the city itself hangs in the balance. The story unfolds with each session, revealing new twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seats. Will we be able to navigate the treacherous waters of vampire politics and fulfill our mission? Only time will tell as the game progresses and our characters face the challenges that lie ahead.
