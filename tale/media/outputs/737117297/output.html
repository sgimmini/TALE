     In the year 2050, the Tower of Babylon stood tall in the desert of Dubai, a monstrous mega-structure that symbolized the connection between the past and the present. This architectural marvel combined historical elements with 21st-century technology, housing both experimental labs and ancient temples. However, the purpose of the tower remained a mystery, shrouded in secrets.

Our story begins in a seminar room where Pierre, Lara, and Blaze anxiously await the start of a psychological experiment. Elara and Blaze fidget with a spinner while they observe the adjacent ultra-modern laboratory, filled with computers and lasers.
