     In the southern part of the Ruhr area, specifically in Essen, lies a divided city. The better cities and domes are located in the south, while the northern part is considered cheaper. Underground, there are old tunnels from mining activities, and the majority of the population lives below ground. Tunnel collapses, floods, and gas outbreaks are common occurrences, especially during the rainy seasons. Travel between domes is done through vacuum trains categorized into classes 1 to 7.

Our protagonist, Chrom, lives in a camping wagon and has a rather peculiar sleeping arrangement with a VR headset and burnt hair. Adelle, a biker, is on a mission to find her missing sister, Nugget, who is only 12 years old. Adelle is accompanied by her biker gang, "Snakes on Wheels." Chrom stumbles upon footage of Nugget on cameras, revealing that she had left the trailer park with other children but never returned. It is common for kids to venture to Ruhrtal at night to scavenge for trash. In a desperate attempt to find Nugget, Adelle announces that whoever finds her will receive her bike, sparking a city-wide search.

     Chrom comes up with a clever plan to attach a tracking chip to someone's drone to aid in the search. However, in the process, he accidentally breaks the floodgate, leaving it open and unable to be closed. Undeterred by the severe storm that ensues, the search for Nugget continues. Chrom tirelessly scours through piles of trash, hoping to find any trace of Nugget. And finally, his efforts pay off when he discovers her in a cave, accompanied by two junk wolves.

Meanwhile, the scene shifts to a DaSun bar called "Die Karibik," owned by TempestTech. The atmosphere inside is oppressively hot and humid, with dark alleys and corridors illuminated by flickering neon lights. Our new protagonist, Eagle Passant, enters the bar and is immediately greeted by the sound of water and laughter. The bar is situated on a white sandy beach, with azure water and children playing ball. iClone WaterDwellers circle near the ceiling, adding to the ambiance. Several bar islands are scattered along the beach, attracting a multitude of guests. However, a high fence separates the higher-class area from the "Economy" section, and signs warn that TempestTech is not liable for any drowning incidents, despite the shallow water.

     Eagle finds himself in a personal conflict with Samuel Sanchez Gonzalez, a new member of the MilPool team who used to work for CrisisInvest. Augusta, a nun dressed in high heels, approaches Eagle and asks him to secretly race against Gonzalez. Official races are held on their way to work, and Eagle, driving a BMW T5, skillfully maneuvers around Gonzalez, causing him to crash into a pillar.

In a small alley, electromagnetic radiation fills the air, emanating from nearby capsule hotels. Bitwise, a small and unkempt character, resides in one of these capsule hotels and hides Neuralink clinics as headphones. Bitwise yearns to enter the Fog of War, a place of absolute anonymity. However, rumors circulate that all exits are currently being monitored, causing unrest among those who demand their right to anonymity. The Kis, a group of individuals, attempt to enter but are unsuccessful. They stage a demonstration, demanding freedom from the Red Star and ID, entities that prevent them from ever achieving true anonymity.

     As the story progresses, we learn more about the headquarters located in an old coal power plant that has been converted into a theme park. The headquarters, situated under the large Knappenhalte in Bottrop, is filled with garbage. To reach the headquarters from Essen, one must pass under the Emscher. The area has been partially greened, but during the monsoon season, the water is the first to be affected. The entrance to the headquarters is marked by a flickering sign that reads "Schlackecenter" above the gate.

Inside the headquarters, there are decommissioned Ferris wheels, roller coasters, and chimneys. A greenish glowing pool catches the eye, and a door leads downwards. Through a chimney entrance, there is a garage for airplanes that resembles a mall with shopping centers, casinos, and parks on different levels. However, caution is advised as the road leading to the headquarters is potentially dangerous due to races taking place there. TempestTech occasionally delivers supplies to the area, but warning signs remind people not to proceed further, as it would violate a corporate policy.

Deep within the pool lies a lid that, when lifted, reveals radiation from radioactive materials. This discovery adds an air of mystery and danger to the headquarters, hinting at the secrets that lie within its walls.

And so, the story unfolds, weaving together the lives of Chrom, Adelle, Eagle, Bitwise, and the mysteries surrounding the headquarters. Each character's journey intertwines, creating a captivating narrative set in the dystopian world of Essen.
