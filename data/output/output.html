     In the tabletop roleplaying game, the setting is in Essen, specifically in the southern part of the Ruhr area. The southern part is known for its better cities and domes, while the northern part is considered cheaper. The population is extremely high, with most people living underground in old tunnels due to past mining activities. However, these tunnels are prone to collapses, floods, and gas outbreaks, especially during the rainy season. Travel between domes is done through vacuum trains called tubes, categorized into classes 1 to 7. The area is inhabited by YiQiRen (Ais), as well as rats, cockroaches, and iClone animals. Trash is abundant due to the lack of proper environmental conditions. Food production relies heavily on the iClone Food Print, with mushrooms being a luxury item and vegetables only available once a week for the upper class. Access to the Ornithoper is regulated through a deep exhaust air shaft.

One of the characters, Chrom, lives in a camping trailer and sleeps with a VR headset and burnt hair. Another character, Adelle, is a biker who is searching for her missing sister, Nugget, a 12-year-old girl. Adelle carries a weapon called "Snakes on Wheels." Chrom discovers on the cameras that Nugget went out with other children from the trailer park but did not return. It is mentioned that children usually go to the Ruhrtal at night to collect trash. Adelle makes an announcement offering her bike as a reward for finding Nugget, prompting everyone to start searching. Chrom comes up with the idea of attaching a tracking chip to someone's drone. However, he accidentally damages the floodgate, leaving it permanently open. As a storm approaches, everyone continues searching, and Chrom eventually finds Nugget in a cave with two scrap wolves.

     The scene then shifts to DaSun, specifically a place called "Die Karibik." The atmosphere is described as hot and suffocating, with dark alleys and flickering neon lights. The protagonist enters a door under a bright neon light, revealing the name "Die Karibik: Eine DaSun experience brought to you by Tempest Tech." After passing through a security check, they step out into the sun, where the sound of water and laughter fills the air. The beach features white sand and azure water, with children playing and iClone-WaterDwellers circling above. Several bars are scattered along the beach, separated from the "Economy" section by a high fence. Despite the shallow water, signs warn about Tempest Tech not being liable for drowning incidents.

     The story then focuses on Augusta, who is wearing a unique outfit consisting of high heels, a hijab, and a nun costume. Samuel Sanchez Gonzalez, a new member of MilPool, has joined her team, CrisisInvest. Augusta is tasked with racing against a rival who drives a KMW-Stier. They set off in the morning, and Augusta uses a Paso Doble dance move to control the rival's car and crash it into a bridge pillar.

     In another scene set in a small alley, there are numerous capsule hotels. The area is known for high levels of electromagnetic radiation, which can cause illness. The protagonist lives in one of the capsules and conceals neural link clinics as headphones. They appear unkempt and small in stature. They connect to the Matrix and aim to reach the Fog of War, a place of absolute anonymity. Their avatar is a standard humanoid figure made of black hole material. Inside the Fog of War, there is unrest as all exits are reportedly under surveillance. The Kis, a group of individuals, are unable to enter and demand their right to anonymity. The Red Star and ID prevent them from ever achieving true anonymity, leading to a demonstration.

     In the prologue, the headquarters of the game is described as being located in an old coal power plant that was transformed into a theme park. The headquarters is situated under the large Knappenhalte in Bottrop and is filled with trash. To reach the headquarters from Essen, one must pass under the Emscher. Efforts to re-green the area are underway, but the water is the first to be affected during the monsoon season. The entrance to the headquarters has a sign above the gate that reads "Schlackecenter" in flickering letters. Inside, there is a deactivated Ferris wheel, roller coasters, chimneys, and a greenish glowing pool. There is an entrance door that leads downstairs, and through a chimney entrance, there is a garage for airplanes. The garage area resembles a mall with shopping centers, casinos, and parks on different levels. The street leading to the headquarters is potentially dangerous due to races that take place there, and Tempest Tech occasionally delivers supplies to the headquarters. There are warning signs indicating the area is "deadly" and that proceeding would be a violation of Tempest Tech corporate policy. Deep down in the pool, there is a lid that, when lifted, reveals radiation from radioactive sources.



Overall, the game takes place in the city of Essen, with different characters experiencing various events and locations within the city. The timeline of events includes Chrom searching for Nugget, the scene in DaSun at "Die Karibik," Augusta's race against a rival, and the protagonist's journey through the capsule hotels and the Fog of War. The prologue provides a description of the headquarters and its surroundings.
