NOTE 

In the lore, the game is set in Essen, a city in the southern part of the Ruhr area. The southern part is known for its better cities and domes, while the northern part is considered cheaper. The city has a high population, with most people living underground due to the presence of old tunnels from mining activities. Tunnel collapses, floods, and gas eruptions are common occurrences, especially during the rainy seasons. Travel between domes is done through vacuum trains categorized into classes 1 to 7. The city is inhabited by YiQiRen (Ais), rats, cockroaches, and iClone animals. Environmental concerns are lacking, resulting in a significant amount of trash. Food production relies on the iClone Food Print, with mushrooms being a luxury item and vegetables only available once a week for the upper class. Access to the Ornithoper is regulated through a deep exhaust air shaft.

(1) Chrom, wearing a VR headset and with burnt hair, sits inside his camping trailer in the underground city of Essen. The trailer is cluttered with various gadgets and makeshift furniture. Outside, the rain pours heavily, causing the tunnel to flood. The scene is dimly lit, with a gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere. The walls are covered in graffiti and dampness. Chrom discovers a video footage of Nugget leaving the trailer park with other children, but not returning. The video is glitchy and distorted, adding to the eerie vibe. The colors are desaturated, with a blue tint to emphasize the underground setting.

(2) Adelle, a biker with a rugged appearance, stands in the middle of the trailer park, holding her weapon 'Snakes on Wheels.' She announces to the residents that whoever finds her missing sister, Nugget, will receive her bike as a reward. The scene is chaotic, with people searching through piles of trash and abandoned vehicles. The rain continues to pour, creating a muddy and gritty environment. The colors are muted, with a mix of earthy tones and neon lights reflecting off the wet surfaces. The mood is tense and desperate, with a sense of urgency in the air.

In another scene, the characters find themselves in a small alley filled with capsule hotels. The area is filled with electromagnetic radiation, creating a buzzing and disorienting atmosphere. The scene is dimly lit, with flickering neon lights and graffiti-covered walls. The colors are muted, with a mix of cool tones and occasional pops of neon. The mood is mysterious and eerie, with a sense of unease and tension. The image should capture the cramped and claustrophobic nature of the alley, with the characters navigating through the maze-like environment.

One character lives in a capsule hotel and wears hidden Neurallink clinics as headphones. They appear unkempt and small in stature, blending into the futuristic surroundings. The scene is set inside the capsule hotel room
