The game is set in Essen, a city located in the southern part of the Ruhr region (1). The region is known for its better cities and domes, with the northern part being more affordable. Essen has a high population, with most people living underground due to numerous old tunnels from mining activities (2). Tunnel collapses, floods, and gas eruptions are common, especially during the rainy season. Travel between domes is done through tubes, which are vacuum trains divided into classes 1 to 7 (7). The area is inhabited by YiQiRen (Ais), rats, cockroaches, and iClone animals. Trash is abundant due to the lack of a healthy environment. Food is produced using iClone Food Print, with mushrooms being a luxury item and vegetables only available once a week for the upper class. Ornithoper access is regulated through a deep exhaust ventilation shaft.

The players include Chrom, who lives in a camping trailer and sleeps with a VR headset and burnt hair (2). Adelle is a biker searching for her sister, Nugget, a 12-year-old girl. Adelle carries "Snakes on Wheels" with her (3). Chrom discovers on the cameras that Nugget left with other children from the trailer park and hasn't returned (4). It is mentioned that children usually go to the Ruhrtal at night to collect garbage (2). Adelle offers her bike as a reward for finding Nugget, and the group begins searching (3). Chrom suggests attaching a tracking chip to a drone and accidentally damages the floodgate, leaving it permanently open (4). As they continue searching, a severe storm approaches (5). Eventually, Chrom finds Nugget in a cave with two junkwolves and an iClone creature (6).

The notes transition to "Die Karibik," a different location with a white sandy beach and azure water (7). The area is divided by a fence, separating the higher-class section from the economy one. Signs warn about drowning liability (7). Augusta, wearing stiletto heels, a hijab, and a sexy nun outfit, works for MilPool and brings Samuel Sanchez Gonzalez, a new team member (7). Augusta and CrisisInvest want the player to race against someone they have a beef with. The player drives a BMW T5 tank class car, and their opponent drives a KMW-Stier. The race occurs early in the morning, and the player crashes the opponent's car into a bridge pillar by performing a Paso Doble. 

In another part of the city, the player character is in an alley with capsule hotels. Electrical radiation in the area is mentioned as harmful (9). The player character resides in one of the capsules and wears hidden neural link clinics as headphones. They connect to the Matrix and aim to reach the Fog of War, a place of complete anonymity (9). Inside the Fog of War, unrest is noticed as all exits are monitored (9). Some individuals called the Kis protest for their right to anonymity but are unable to enter due to the Red Star and the ID system preventing true anonymity (9).

The main headquarters of the team is located in an old coal power plant in Bottrop, beneath a large miner statue (11). The area is filled with trash, but efforts are being made to restore it with greenery. The headquarters has a pool of greenish glowing water, a door leading down, and a garage for airplanes accessed through a chimney (11). The garage area resembles a mall with shopping centers, casinos, and parks on different levels. Illegal races take place on the nearby road, making it potentially dangerous (11). Tempest Tech occasionally delivers supplies to the headquarters. Warning signs indicate potential breaches of Tempest Tech corporate guidelines by going further (11). A deep pool in the headquarters has a lid that reveals radiation from radioactive materials when lifted, requiring annual inspection and maintenance (11).

The events in the game start one day after the previous session. The team meets for their weekly meeting. The Raptor egg is pulsating as the Raptor inside is being trained (8). Eagle enters a fear simulation and confronts a poorly programmed T-Rex, leaving a lasting impression on the Raptor before disconnecting (8). During the meeting, two large GMC cars enter the team's base, guarded (8).
