     NOTE 

In the lore, the game is set in Essen, a city in the southern part of the Ruhr area. The southern part is known for its better cities and domes, while the northern part is considered cheaper. The city has a high population, with most people living underground due to the presence of old tunnels from mining activities. Tunnel collapses, floods, and gas eruptions are common occurrences, especially during the rainy seasons. Travel between domes is done through vacuum trains categorized into classes 1 to 7. The city is inhabited by YiQiRen (Ais), rats, cockroaches, and iClone animals. Environmental concerns are lacking, resulting in a significant amount of trash. Food production relies on the iClone Food Print, with mushrooms being a luxury item and vegetables only available once a week for the upper class. Access to the Ornithoper is regulated through a deep exhaust air shaft.

(1) Chrom, wearing a VR headset and with burnt hair, sits inside his camping trailer in the underground city of Essen. The trailer is cluttered with various gadgets and makeshift furniture. Outside, the rain pours heavily, causing the tunnel to flood. The scene is dimly lit, with a gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere. The walls are covered in graffiti and dampness. Chrom discovers a video footage of Nugget leaving the trailer park with other children, but not returning. The video is glitchy and distorted, adding to the eerie vibe. The colors are desaturated, with a blue tint to emphasize the underground setting.
